To run a notebook server with the necessary dependencies, do:

    > run_notebook.sh
    
    
To process features, build a model, and make predictions on the test set, do:


    > ./run_predictions.sh
    
    
This will run the model-building process inside a Docker container that contains all the necessary dependencies.
